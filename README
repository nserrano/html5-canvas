This is a KSpike for demonstrating the HTML5 Canvas object. It was written
during 90 minutes at KHelg (Competence Weekend) 2010:3 at Hemmeslöv Herrgård.

Open the index.html file in a (modern) browser to start the game. This is
what you do:

 git clone git://github.com/ulsa/html5-canvas.git
 cd html5-canvas
 open src/index.html

Use the arrow keys to move your Jay, but avoid getting hit by evil balls.
